The article presents a comprehensive study on the supercritical fluid extraction of essential oil from chamomile flowers, focusing on model dynamics and applying a distributed-parameter model to describe the fluid-solid extraction process. By employing the concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow, the study simplifies the spatial dimensions of the extraction process, ensuring uniform flow across any cross-section while allowing for variations in the area available for the fluid phase. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The model was validated under multiple constant operating conditions: $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. The model dynamic is investigated by analysing how sensitive the model output is to model parameters. In this work, the local sensitivity analysis is introduced and used to examine the influence of infinitely small changes in the pressure on the model's state space and the extraction yield.
