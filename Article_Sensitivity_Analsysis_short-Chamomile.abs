This study aims to investigate the extraction process of caraway oil from chamomile flowers. A mathematical model is used to describe the governing mass transfer phenomena in a solid-fluid environment under supercritical conditions using carbon dioxide as a solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. A set of laboratory experiments was performed under multiple constant operating conditions: $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. Different sensitivity analysis methods can be applied to assess the robustness of the model parameters and its influence on the process model. The local sensitivity analysis investigates the influence of infinitely small changes in the model parameters and the controls on model output. In particular,  this work focuses on analysing the step change of pressure on the extraction yield and the model state space.
