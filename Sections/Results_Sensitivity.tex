	%This work investigates the influence of pressure change on the state space and the extraction yield. The process model and parameters have been discussed in {\color{red}article 1}. The process model was calibrated on the set of experiments obtained at different operating conditions, $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. The sensitivity analysis has been performed assuming that the system operates in the middle of validate range, hence at $35^\circ C$, 150 bar and 5 $\cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s.
	
	This study examines the impact of pressure change on the state space and extraction yield. The process model and parameters are described in {\color{red}article 1}. Calibration of the process model is based on experiments performed under multiple  operating conditions: temperatures between $30 - 40^\circ C$, pressures between $100 - 200$ bar, and mass flow rates between $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. The local sensitivity analysis was conducted, assuming the system operates at the midpoint of the validated range: $35^\circ C$, 150 bar and 5 $\cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s.
