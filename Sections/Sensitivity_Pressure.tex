    %\subsection{Pressure}
	
	As discussed in Chapter \ref{CH:Governing_equations_chapter}, a small pressure wave propagates at the speed of sound relative to the flow. If the flow velocity is relatively low, all pressure changes are hydrodynamic (resulting from velocity motion) rather than thermodynamic. The Low Mach-number assumption leads to instant propagation of the thermodynamic pressure throughout the system. A single pressure value can be considered for the entire system, as all changes occur simultaneously throughout the device. A step-function shown in Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivty_P_P} illustrates the pressure change in the extractor.

	The model is built such that the pressure change first affects $\frac{dP}{dt}$, and in the next time step, the energy balance through $\frac{\partial (P(t) A_f)}{\partial t}$, leading to the step change along the whole system as presented in Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivty_P_H}. The energy balance response becomes noticeable, as well as the change in the physical properties of the solvent. The uniform response across the entire extraction column length, represented by the homogeneously dark red colour, indicates that the whole system experiences an immediate and uniform change in enthalpy density in response to pressure changes. 
	
	The pressure change affects the fluid's temperature inside the computational domain, but boundary values are subject to constraints specified at the extremes of that domain. Applying the Dirichlet boundary conditions assumes a fixed temperature value at the inlet, which can lead to a thermal gradient propagating along the system. In contrast, Neumann boundary conditions would dictate the heat flux at the boundaries. In this work, the Neumann boundary conditions equal to zero were applied to ensure that the temperatures at the inlet, the outlet, and the middle of the extractor are the same all the time.

	Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivty_P_CS} shows the sensitivity of the solute concentration in the solid phase with respect to pressure change along a fixed bed in a supercritical fluid extraction process. As discussed in Chapter \ref{CH: Continuity}, the velocity of a fluid is inversely proportional to its density, which suggests that the pressure increase decreases the velocity. This leads to an extended residence time, ergo, a longer interaction between the solute and the solvent. Initially, the extraction process is in the kinetically-controlled regime, where the concentration gradient is high, and the limiting factor is the solute solubility. As discussed in ({\color{red}article 1}), the system is considered to be far from saturation, which can explain the low system response at the beginning of the process. The system response becomes more evident when the concentration gradient starts diminishing, and the extraction switches from the kinetic-controlled to the diffusion-controlled regime. The negative sign can be interpreted as a faster solute loss from the solid phase, which corresponds to enhanced mass transfer. Over time, the amount of solute becomes a limiting factor, and the pressure change has a lower effect on the system, increasing the negative sensitivities. Sensitivities approach zero asymptotically when the solid bed is exhausted of the solute.

	Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivty_P_CF} shows how sensitive is the solute concentration in the fluid phase to the pressure change. Although the pressure increase enhances the mass transfer, the system response is initially low, which reflects the idle period discussed above. Later, the sensitivities increase due to faster solute loss from the solid phase, which indicates that more solute is transported to the fluid phase. When the amount of solute in the solid phase becomes a limiting factor, the extraction rate slows down, sensitivities decline asymptotic towards zero, and the impact of the pressure change gradually decreases. As the fluid phase is mobile, the advection causes the sensitivities to move along the system analogously to the solute in the fluid phase.

	Figure \ref{fig:Sensitivty_P_y} illustrates how sensitive the extraction yield is to the pressure change. Initially, the sensitivity curve stays almost flat, suggesting a latency in the system's response to pressure changes. Due to the decreased velocity of the fluid, the solute reaches the extractor's outlet later, which causes minor negative sensitivities to appear. The process continues, and the sensitivity curve increases rapidly when the solute reaches the extractor's outlet. The positive yield sensitivity indicates improved process efficiency, which is directly related to enhanced mass transfer. The peak in $\frac{dy}{dP}$ reflects when the deviation from the original system is the largest. Beyond the peak, the sensitivity declines and converges towards zero. The concentration gradient becomes a limiting factor, and the enhanced mass transfer no longer plays a dominant role compared to the original system.
