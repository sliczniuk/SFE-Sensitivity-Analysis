This study investigates the process of chamomile oil extraction from chamomile flowers. A parameter-distributed model, consisting of a set of partial differential equations, was used to describe the governing mass transfer phenomena between solid and fluid phases under supercritical conditions using carbon dioxide as the solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow was applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow of carbon dioxide is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent were estimated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Laboratory experiments were conducted under various, but constant operating conditions of $30 - 40~^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. The local sensitivity analysis method was applied to evaluate the robustness of the model parameters by investigating the impact of infinitesimally small changes in the model parameters and controls on the model outputs. This study focuses on analysing the effect of pressure on the model state space and extraction yield. {\color{blue}It was found that the model is the most sensitive to the controls if operated close to the critical point.}
