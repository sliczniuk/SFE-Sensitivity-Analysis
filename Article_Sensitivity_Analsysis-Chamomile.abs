This study investigates the process of chamomile oil extraction from chamomile flowers. A parameter-distributed model, consisting of a set of partial differential equations, is used to describe the governing mass transfer phenomena between solid and fluid phases under supercritical conditions using carbon dioxide as the solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Laboratory experiments were conducted under various, but constant operating conditions: $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. Different sensitivity analysis methods can be applied to assess the robustness of the model parameters and their influence on the process model. Local sensitivity analysis investigates the impact of infinitesimally small changes in model parameters and controls on model output. This study focuses on analysing the effect of pressure on the model state space and extraction yield.
