This study investigates the process of chamomile oil extraction from chamomile flowers. A parameter-distributed model, consisting of a set of partial differential equations, is used to describe the governing mass transfer phenomena between solid and fluid phases under supercritical conditions using carbon dioxide as the solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The {\color{blue}flow of carbon dioxide} is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated using the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Laboratory experiments were conducted under various, but constant operating conditions. $30 - 40~^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. {\color{blue}The local sensitivity analysis method was applied to evaluate the model parameters' robustness by investigating the impact of infinitesimally small changes in model parameters and controls on model outputs}. This study focuses on analysing the effect of pressure on the model state space and extraction yield.
